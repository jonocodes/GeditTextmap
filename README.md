This is a Gedit plugin for displaying a 10,000 foot view of your code in the sidebar. It is based on Dan Gindikin's original code, but has been updated to work with Gedit 3.

To install this plugin copy the files into ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/ and restart Gedit. Then activate the plugin through the preferences.
